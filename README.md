# Learning Activities & Resources
This week, we were supposed to set up our XAMPP for PHP. I faced a lot of issues because of Mac as the environment variables could not be set as easily on Mac as on Windows. The reason was because there was no direct way of editing the configuration files. I struggled a lot with YouTube videos on Terminal (Command Prompt for Windows) but was still unable to edit the files because of lack of knowledge and expertise in that area.

# Estimated Hours
I spent about a day on the Practical for Week 7. There was a lot of troubleshooting especially because of the environment variables part because it was not working on Mac.

# Content Insights
I learnt about PHP coding and how to use if/else decision structures and repetition structures like for, while and foreach. It was pretty similar to Python and syntax was easy to grasp. I learnt from websites such as GeeksforGeeks and W3Schools etc, known widely for their clear way of explaining language-specific concepts.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This greatly helps in building websites and helps us understand the backend ie. PHP coding. I think this will come in pretty handy in the future as it is a versatile language and can help in building websites exactly how we want them to be. It is also widely used in workplaces to build dynamic and highly interactive websites.
